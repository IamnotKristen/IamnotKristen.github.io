                Hi, my name is Kristen and I am studying a double degree; Bachelor in Arts/Bachelor in Teaching
                (Mathematics). I have completed my first practical at Gilroy Catholic College and appreciated the opportunity to
                teach the students at the college. The grades that I was able to teach were year 7, 8, 11 and 12. What I enjoy the most experience was that I was able to apply what I have learnt in University which came in good use and to
                be able to help students to improve in Mathematics, ICT and Design and Tech. Constructing different lesson plans to explain and dissect 
                Mathematics, ICT and Design and Tech in a way that is easy to understands, whilst creating a safe environment for students to learn
                and to be able to freely voice their ideas and opinions.

                  Development of numerator and problem-solvingsolving skills is critical for
                  every student. Focusing on develop sophisticated understading on Mathematics along with in-depth critical thinking, students are prepared with knowledge and ability to interpret using their own words, and using their own method to solve problems, even in a context outside mathematics. Which is an essential skills that is needed in the 21st century.

                      <strong>Summative Assessment</strong> &ndash; assessment that show demonstration
                      and mastery of a concept that evaluate student learning at the end of an 
                      instructional unit, also including the comparision of their pre and post tests.

                      <strong>Formative Assessment</strong> &ndash; to monitor student learning to provide 
                      ongoing feedback that can be used by instructors to improve their teaching 
                      and by students to improve their learning. More specifically, formative assessments: 
                      help students identify their strengths and weaknesses and target areas that need work to 
                      assess the need for adjustment in instruction to increase student
                      learning and understanding.
                      <br />
                      <em>Example:</em> When results of an exit slip showed
                      students did not grasp the desired concept, instructional
                      plans were adjusted enable teachers to quickly assess students' 
                      understanding of the concept or also utilize a different approach allowed
                      students to learn more effectively.

                    <li>
                      <strong>Informal Assessment</strong> &ndash; an intuitive assessment method 
                      where teachers do not evaluate student performances on some grade or metrics, but 
                      rather focus on observing students' performances and progress at different stages 
                      of their learning time frame. It is conducted using various forms of evaluation and ongoing
                      monitoring to evaluate student comprehension and therefore modifying lesson plans as needed.
                      <br />
                      <em>Example:</em> When a quick demonstration on a whiteboard
                      revealed whether or not students have understood the lesson’s
                      objective, therefore instead of moving on, I would pause and 
                      reinforce the concept through another method.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Student Formative Self-Assessment</strong> &ndash; to 
                      monitor student learning to provide ongoing feedback 
                      that can be used by instructors to improve their teaching 
                      and by students to improve their learning. More specifically, 
                      formative assessments: help students identify their strengths 
                      and weaknesses and target their own learning goals.
                      <br />
                      <em>Example:</em> Allowed students to think and write
                      about their understanding of a math lesson, explain their
                      strategies and reasoning to solve problems using their own 
                      words and to communication for a solution.

                      <em>Example:</em> Incorporated Presentation activities that

                      content by sketching, writing or audio/video recording their math
                      thinking using their own words.

                      <em>Example:</em> In a collaborative project, students
                      wrote, typed and shared a Google document across the entire cohort. 
                      This allowed students to use technology while also working on numeracy skill,
                      learning maths content whilst practicing their literacy standards.

                      I did refer to the student's personal interest of their favorite K-pop groups and therefore 
                      was able to delivered the knowledge more effectively.
                      Interacting with the student and allowing students to interact and communicate with each other encourge and foster their love to learning.
